#  WELCOME TO THE REFERENCE SHEET FOR HACKMUD

This script is very straight forward.<br />
It simply returns a json that contains scraped information on the NPC's of the game Hackmud.<br />
The scripts purpose is to be implemented as a subscript into player scripts to use sections of the data for their purposes instead of hardcoding it into their script or making slow database fetches.

## Other projects
- [x] Tier 1 company BigList scraper (temp01_scripts.scrape_locs)
- [x] Tier 1 lock breaker (temp01_scripts.unl0ck_v1 (2KGC escrow))
## Planned projects
- [ ] Tier 2 lock breaker (in progress)
- [ ] Tier 2 location scraper (planned)
- [ ] And more to come.
